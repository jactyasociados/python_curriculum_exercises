# Write a Python program that uses BeautifulSoup to go to https://news.google.com 
# and prints out all of the headlines on the page. 

# Then, write a function called find_headline_by_keyword which lets you search 
# through those headlines for keywords, and returns to you a list of all of the 
# headlines that match all the keywords you provide.
